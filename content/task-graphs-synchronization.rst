===================================================

.. questions::

   - How can you express dependencies between SYCL_ parallel kernels?

.. objectives::

   - Learn how to handle data movements in SYCL_.


.. todo::

   Mix of topics from chapters 3 "Data management" (section "Ordering the Uses
   of Data"), chapters 8 "Scheduling kernels and data momevent" and 9
   "Communication and synchronization"

   - In-order queues
